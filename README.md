# Foosball api
This is a golang api you can use to create a foosball app (or any 2v2 game in general)!
This is in heavy development and will most likely never be finished :(

This is basically just a project for me to get more knowledge about golang (and sql hehe)

## To do (most of this will NEVER be done)
- [x] Creation of users, and login
- [x] Auth flow with tokens and refresh token
- [x] Organization creation
- [x] Organization settings
- [ ] Maybe improve auth flow?
- [ ] Seasons
- [ ] Lobby creation, and logic around lobbys in general
- [ ] Set up game creation, and game recording
- [ ] Elo system
- [ ] Rankings
- [ ] Fun stat page
- [ ] Tournament mode
- [ ] Fun features
